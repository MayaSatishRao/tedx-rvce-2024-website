                Ashwini Neetan is the visionary artist behind Tiny Yawns Photography, specialising in the tender moments
                of maternity and newborn photography. With an innate ability to capture the delicate beauty of new life,
                Ashwini brings a unique blend of creativity and compassion to every session. Drawing inspiration from
                the profound connection between mother and child, her work encapsulates the joy, anticipation, and sheer
                wonder of this precious time. Through Tiny Yawns Photography, Ashwini invites expecting parents to
                embark on a journey of timeless memories, preserving the fleeting moments of pregnancy and the tender
                innocence of newborns in stunning detail. With each click of the shutter, Ashwini crafts images that
                serve as cherished mementos, forever capturing the love and magic of this extraordinary
                chapter in life.

                She started off as a travel photographer 13 years ago and somewhere in the middle, babies caught her
                attention and she heard her calling! From being featured in multiple newspapers and magazines to getting
                felicitated by CM Siddaramaiah in 2017 in Vidhana Soudha to recently being recognised by Nikon, a leader
                in the world of cameras as an ‘Official Nikon
                Expertive/Creator’ – the path she chose and the way she pursued it, gave her a purpose and made it all
                meaningful. And her purpose being – to work hard everyday, enthusiastically – to
                meet newborn babies and pregnant mommas to give them memories that last through generations!
